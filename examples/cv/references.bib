	abstract = {We recently reported that targeted deletion of Pannexin 1 in neural precursor cells of the ventricular zone impairs the maintenance of these cells in healthy and stroke-injured brain. Here we frame this exciting new finding in the context of our previous studies on Pannexin 1 in neural precursors as well as the close relationship between Pannexin 1 and purinergic receptors established by other groups. Moreover, we identify important gaps in our understanding of Pannexin 1 in neural precursor cell biology in terms of the underlying molecular mechanisms and functional/behavioural outcomes.},

	abstract = {Purpose After cortical stroke, neural precursor cells ({NPCs}) in the distal ventricular zone ({VZ}) proliferate more rapidly and migrate toward the injured cortex. While evidence suggests this can enhance stroke recovery, the underlying molecular mechanisms initiating the response are poorly understood. Here we identified changes in protein expression in the ipsilateral {VZ} early (4 h) after stroke to gain insight into the initial mechanisms involved in {NPC} activation post-stroke. Experimental design Four hours after photothrombotic stroke (or sham surgery control) in the sensorimotor cortex, adult mice (10 stroke, 10 sham) were subjected to cardiac perfusion with {PBS}, and ipsilateral and contralateral {VZ} tissue was microdissected. Two separate sets of ipsilateral and contralateral {VZ} tissues (from 5 pooled surgery or 5 pooled sham mice) were analyzed simultaneously using 8-plex {iTRAQ}. We used Western blotting and confocal microscopy to confirm changes in protein expression in the {VZ} ipsilateral to stroke in a separate cohort of mice. Results We identified nine proteins which exhibited a significant mean increase (by ≥ 2-fold) in stroke ipsilateral compared to sham ipsilateral. Many of these proteins were antiproteases or cytokine/growth factor binding proteins that are known to act as inflammatory responders or effectors and play roles in modulating tissue growth and remodeling. Conclusion and clinical relevance These novel findings support a growing body of literature that inflammatory signaling is involved in the {NPC} response to brain injury and identifies novel potential targets that could be exploited to better understand and to optimize this regenerative response.},

	abstract = {Purinergic signaling encompasses the cycle of adenosine 5′ triphosphate (ATP) release and its metabolism into nucleotide and nucleoside derivatives, the direct release of nucleosides, and subsequent receptor-triggered downstream intracellular pathways. Since the discovery of nerve terminal and glial ATP release into the neuropil, purinergic signaling has been implicated in the modulation of nervous system development, function, and disease. In this review, we detail our current understanding of the roles of the pannexin 1 (PANX1) ATP-release channel in neuronal development and plasticity, glial signaling, and neuron-glial-immune interactions. We additionally provide an overview of PANX1 structure, activation, and permeability to orientate readers and highlight recent research developments. We identify areas of convergence between PANX1 and purinergic receptor actions. Additional highlights include data on PANX1's participation in the pathophysiology of nervous system developmental, degenerative, and inflammatory disorders. Our aim in combining this knowledge is to facilitate the movement of our current understanding of PANX1 in the context of other nervous system purinergic signaling mechanisms one step closer to clinical translation.},
